🛠️ Verilog Internship Projects
This repository contains Verilog codes and testbenches developed as part of my VLSI internship and learning journey.
Each project focuses on designing, simulating, and understanding fundamental digital modules.

✅ PROJECT 1 – 2:1 Multiplexer (MUX2_1)
A basic 2:1 multiplexer that:

Selects between two input signals based on a single select line

Outputs the chosen input

Verified using a functional testbench

📂 Files:

Verilog design file (MUX2_1.v)

Testbench file for simulation (tb_MUX2_1.v)

🛠 Tech: Verilog HDL, testbench creation, simulation in Vivado

✅ PROJECT 2 – 2-input AND Gate (AND2_input)
A simple digital logic module that:

Computes the logical AND of two input signals (a and b)

Outputs the result to c

Verified using a functional testbench that systematically applies all four possible input combinations and observes the output

📂 Files:

Verilog design file (AND2_input.v)

Testbench file for simulation (tb_AND2_input.v)

🛠 Tech: Verilog HDL, testbench creation, simulation in Vivado

📌 More projects coming soon...

🚀 How to run simulations

Open Vivado (or any Verilog simulator of your choice)

Add the Verilog design file and corresponding testbench file to your project

Set the testbench as the top module

Run behavioral simulation to verify the functionality

Observe console outputs and waveform results

📌 Upcoming improvements

Better folder organization (e.g., separate folders per project)

Waveform screenshots of simulation results

Detailed Markdown explanations for each module’s working

Possibly GitHub Actions to auto-check code style and syntax

🤝 Contributions

Currently, this is a personal learning repository.
In the future, I might open it for contributions to include more basic digital designs and testbenches.
