# 🛠️ Verilog Internship Projects

This repository contains Verilog codes and testbenches developed as part of my VLSI internship and learning journey.  
Each project focuses on designing, simulating, and understanding fundamental digital modules.

## ✅ PROJECT 1 – 2:1 Multiplexer (MUX2_1)

A basic 2:1 multiplexer that:
- Selects between two input signals based on a single select line
- Outputs the chosen input
- Verified using a functional testbench

> 📂 Files:
> - Verilog design file
> - Testbench file for simulation

> 🛠 Tech: Verilog HDL, testbench creation, simulation in Vivado

## 📌 **More projects coming soon**..............

## 🚀 **How to run simulations**
1. Open Vivado (or any Verilog simulator)
2. Add the Verilog source and testbench files to your project
3. Run the simulation to verify functionality

---

## 📌 **Upcoming improvements**
- Better folder organization
- Waveform screenshots of simulation results
- Explanation of each module’s working in Markdown files
- Possibly GitHub Actions to auto-check code style

## 🤝 **Contributions**
Currently, this is a personal learning repository.  
In the future, I might open it for contributions to include other basic digital designs.
