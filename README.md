## 🛠️ Verilog Internship Projects
This repository contains simple Verilog design and testbench projects I built as part of my VLSI internship and learning journey.  
Each project focuses on designing, simulating, and understanding core digital logic modules.

---

✅ **PROJECT 1 – 2:1 Multiplexer (MUX2_1)**  
A basic digital circuit that:

- Selects between two input signals based on a single select line
- Outputs the chosen input
- Tested and verified using a functional testbench

📂 **Files included:**

- `MUX2_1.v` – Verilog design file
- `tb_MUX2_1.v` – Testbench file for simulation

🛠 **Tech:** Verilog HDL, simulation in Vivado, testbench design

---

✅ **PROJECT 2 – 2-input AND Gate (AND2_input)**  
A simple combinational circuit that:

- Computes logical AND of two single-bit inputs (`a` and `b`)
- Outputs the result (`c`)
- Verified by applying all input combinations in a testbench

📂 **Files included:**

- `AND2_input.v` – Verilog design file
- `tb_AND2_input.v` – Testbench file for simulation

🛠 **Tech:** Verilog HDL, simulation in Vivado, testbench design

🚀 **How to run simulations**

- Open Vivado (or any Verilog simulator)
- Add the design and testbench files to your project
- Set the testbench as the top module
- Run simulation and observe waveform or console output

---

📌 **Upcoming improvements**

- Better folder organization (one folder per project)
- Waveform screenshots
- Markdown explanations for each module
- GitHub Actions to check code formatting

🤝 **Contributions**

Currently, this is a personal learning repo.  
In the future, I might open it for contributions to add more digital modules and testbenches.
